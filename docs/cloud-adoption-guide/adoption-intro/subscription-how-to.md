# How to create an Azure subscription

Now that you understand [digital identity](tenant-explainer.md) and [subscriptions](subscription-explainer.md) in Azure, and you've created a user account in your organization's Azure AD tenant, you are ready to create your Azure subscription.

You can establish your subscription by following the guide to [licensing Azure for the enterprise][azure-enterprise-licensing].

> [!NOTE:]
> The Azure Cloud Adoption Guide is designed for enterprises that are adopting Azure for their organization. While much of this guidance is specific to large enterprises, individuals and smaller organizations will find much of this guidance helpful for their Azure adoption as well. If this is your situation, you can create your own Azure subscription via a [free trial][azure-free-trial] or [other available Azure offers][azure-offers].

## Next steps

* Now that you've created your [Azure subscription](subscription-explainer.md), review the [guidance for working with Azure subscriptions](subscription.md).
