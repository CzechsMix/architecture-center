# How to: create an Azure subscription

You've learned about [digital identity](tenant-explainer.md) and [subscriptions](subscription-explainer.md) in Azure, and you've created a user account in your organization's Azure AD tenant. You're now ready to create your Azure subscription.

You can create a subscription by following the guide to [licensing Azure for the enterprise][azure-enterprise-licensing].

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Cloud Adoption Guide is designed for enterprises that are adopting Azure for their organization. Even so, individuals and smaller organizations can benefit from a significant portion of this cloud adoption guidance. These customers can create an Azure subscription via a [free trial][azure-free-trial] or [other available Azure offers][azure-offers].

## Next steps

* Now that you've created your [Azure subscription](subscription-explainer.md), review the [design guidance for Azure subscriptions](subscription.md).
