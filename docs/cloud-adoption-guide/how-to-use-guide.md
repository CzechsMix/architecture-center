# How to use the Azure Cloud Adoption Guide

The Azure Cloud Adoption Guide is organized into a series of stages. Each stage includes a list of documents. The documents fall into one of three categories: documents that **explain** how something works, documents that describe **how to** accomplish a specific task, or documents that provide **guidance** to assist you in making technology choices and design decisions. 

The explainer documents provide background knowledge that makes it easier to understand how to accomplish a specific task. Some of the documents include a short explainer video that you can watch instead of reading the document. As you work through the list of documents, when you reach a 'how to' document, follow the steps to accomplish the task before proceeding. The guidance documents provide best practice recommendations for the task. 

The documents are listed in order, and they are progressive. If you are already familiar with the subject matter in a document, you can move on to the next document in the list. 

# Audience

The audience for the Azure Cloud Adoption Guide includes Enterprise Administrators, Finance, IT operations, IT security and compliance, workload development owners, and workload operations owners.
