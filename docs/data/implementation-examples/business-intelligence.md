# Business intelligence

Azure offers a rich data and analytics platform so you can build scalable BI and reporting solutions. Create rich, interactive reports with [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/) by having it connect to [Azure Analysis Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview/), which uses a highly optimized in-memory engine to provide responses to queries against user-friendly semantic models, within a fraction of a second. The underlying data is provided by [Azure SQL Data Warehouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-overview-what-is), which acts as a central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.
