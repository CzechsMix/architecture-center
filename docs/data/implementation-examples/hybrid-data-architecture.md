# Hybrid data architecture

When you need hybrid on-premises and cloud options, nothing comes close to Azure. Use [Azure Stack](/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-poc) to deliver Azure services from your own datacenter, using the same tools in both environments for unmatched consistency, allowing you to deploy your data solution to the location that best meets your needs. Use [ExpressRoute](/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-connect-expressroute) for a private, dedicated and high speed connection that extends your on-premises network into Azure. See this example [hybrid reference architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/expressroute-vpn-failover).
