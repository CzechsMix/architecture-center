# Advanced analytics and deep learning

Go beyond historical reporting and exploratory analysis of your data by enabling predictive processing and automated decision making with Azure services like [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml) and [Apache Spark on HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql). When you need to harness the power of multiple GPUs to build sophisticated deep neural architectures and train them on a large data set, get a jump start on the task with [Deep Learning Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/deep-learning-dsvm-overview) and [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki), the unified deep-learning toolkit by Microsoft.
