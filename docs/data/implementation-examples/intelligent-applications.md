# Intelligent applications

Quickly add intelligence to your applications with [Cognitive Services](/azure/#pivot=products&panel=cognitive), and coordinate automated interactions using [Azure Bot Service](/bot-framework/bot-service-overview-introduction). This can save you months of creating and refining sophisticated algorithms to naturally interact with your users through speech, text, vision, knowledge, and search capabilities.
